# Zillow Regression Project

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
- the Zillow Data Science team was asked to predict the values of single unit properties. 


## GOALS 

- Predict the values of single unit properties using property data from the Zillow database on the Codeup SQL.¬†The focus will be the properties with a  transaction during the "hot months" of May-August, 2017.

- Plot the distribution of tax rates for each county. (his is separate from the creation of model )
-   Create a presentation of findings

| sq_ft | Property structure square footage | float64|
| county | County associated with property  | int64
| taxamount | Taxes for property | float 64|
| tax_rate | Calculation of (taxamount/ home_value)  |  float 64 |




| Target | Definition | Data Type |
| --- | --- | -------|
| assessed_value_usd | Value of the property | float64 |

### Acquire
- Acquire data from the Codeup Database using my own function to automate this process. This function is saved in acquire.py file.
### Prepare
- Clean and prepare data for preparation step. 
Split dataset into train, validate, test. Separate target from features and scale the selected features. Create a function to automate the process. The function is saved in a prepare.py module. 
### Explore
- Visualize all combinations of variables.Define two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, document findings and takeaways.
### Model
- Extablishing and evaluating a baseline model.
- Document various algorithms and/or hyperparameters you tried along with the evaluation code and results.
- Evaluate the  models using the standard techniques: computing the evaluation metrics (SSE, RMSE, and/or MSE)
- Choose the model that performs the best.
- Evaluate the best model (only one) on the test dataset.


## AUDIENCE 
- The Zillow data science team

## INITIAL IDEAS/ HYPOTHESES STATED
- ùêªùëú : There is no difference in  the average of assessed_value_usd  for the properties with  3  bedrooms  vs 2 bedrooms
- ùêªùëé : There is significant  difference in  the average of assessed_value_usd  for the properties with  3  bedrooms  vs 2 bedrooms

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECREATING PROJECT

- [x] Read this README.md
- [ ] Create a env.py file that has (user, host, password) in order to  get the database 
- [ ] Download the aquire.py, prepare.py, explore.py , model.py,  evaluate.pyand  and  zillow.ipynb into your working directory
- [ ] Run the zillow.ipynb notebook


## DELIVER:
- A report in the form of a presentation. (The report/presentation slides should summarize your findings about the drivers of the single unit property values.)
- A github repository containing my work.
- README file contains project description and goals, data dictionary, project planning, initial ideas/hypotheses, instructions to recreate project.

- Individual modules, .py files, that hold your functions to acquire and prepare your data.
